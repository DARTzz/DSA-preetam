> height vs depth in trees :

- depth is the shortest number of tree traversal steps from root to a node
- height is the longest path to reach node from root.


> AVL TREES :
	- AVL trees maintain Balance factor along with the binary search tree property.
	- Balance is actually height of left node - height of right node 
			- i.e. balance factor = height left - height right.
	- note that height is the longest possible path to reach a node in this case.
	- SO in avl trees for balancing the tree , the balance is to be maintained from -1 to 1, otherwise the tree is unbalanced and needs to be balanced.

>> WORST CASE FOR A BST : when a tree is skewed, i.e. linear like a linear DS, it is the worst case.
		so if the BST is made balanced and the height of the tree is maintainded to log n, the worst case complexity becomes O(log n).. and thats sexy.
