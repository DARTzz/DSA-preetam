How is this different from SSSP ?
  
In this algorithm, we find shortest path of a single destination from all sources.

Hence its kinda that same.
eg. In SSSP, we find the shortest path from headquarter to all other cities in SSSP
whereas, we find Shortest path to the headquarter from all the points to the office in APSP.

so we perfrom SSSP multiple time sto find APSP :) and store the path in a DS.
